# [Polygam](https://dorev.io)
[*Polygam*](https://dorev.io) is a sequencer taking chords as input. The chords evolving in the graph are harmonically related to ease the exploration of different chord progressions.

## How to use
1. Select some chords in the graph (top left thing with letters in bubbles)
2. Punch some notes in the sequencer (maintain clicked to add multiple notes)
3. Hit the Play button
4. Experiment with the remaining knobs
5. Enjoy :)

Some shortcuts will be added overtime, for now only "Space" toggles play/stop.

## My name is what?
[*Polygam*](https://dorev.io) is not meant to encourage multiple & simultaneous romantic relationships, but it can create a really sexy mood if put to good use. But really, "*poly-*" comes from the Tone.js *polysynths* you hear when playing with the app and "*-gam*" is for *gamme*, which is French for *scale*. Scale gymnastics (and romance) are everywhere under this hood.

## What's next...
As you can see there is still a lot that can (and will) be done. You can have a good idea of what's on my plate if you have a look at the [project page](https://github.com/dorev/polygam/projects/1).
